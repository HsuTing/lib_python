- parityjudge(number)

	intput a number and judge if it is a parity number

	example:

		parityjudge(100)

- GCD(number)

	input an array of numbers to find gcd

	example:

		number = [100, 50]
		GCD(number)
	

- class rational

	use this class to calculate rational number
	add, sub, mul, truediv, eq function can use

	add: add two rational number
	sub: sub two rational number
	mul: multiply two rational number
	truediv: divide two rational number
	eq: check two rational number is equal or not equal

	example:

		R1 = ration(5, 7)
		R2 = ration(4, 11)
		R3 = ration(4, 8)

		R3 = R1 + R2
		R3 = R1 - R2
		R3 = R1 * R2
		R3 = R1 / R2
		print(R1 == R2)
